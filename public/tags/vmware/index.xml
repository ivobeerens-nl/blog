VMware has the following statement:&#xA;To date, no VMware products have been found to be critically impacted by CVE-2022-3602 or CVE-2022-3786. Regardless, VMware products that consume OpenSSL 3.0.x will consume 3.0.7 fixes as a precautionary measure in upcoming releases.&#xA;VMware Tools version 12.0.0 and 12.1.0 both contain the OpenSSL 3.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote a blog called “Install Windows 11 as VM on VMware vSphere / Workstation without TPM 2.0 chipset“. In this blog article, I explained how to install Windows 11 without having a TPM 2.0 chipset by using a registry hack. Paul Braren from tinkertry.com created a cool video (link) about installing Windows 11 on VMware vSphere using my blog article. Bob Plankers (@plankers) replied on Twitter that virtual TPM can be used too.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Windows 11 is officially released. Windows 11 require a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0 (link). . My VMware ESXi servers at home don’t have a TPM 2.0. During the installation, Windows will check for the presence of a TPM 2.0, if not available the installation will fail. There is a registry hack available to bypass the TPM 2.0 check. Use this only for demo purposes and not in production environments!</description>

      <description>VMware Tools releases have been decoupled from VMware vSphere release since version 10.0. You can now standardize to the latest VMware Tools by configuring a centralized repository. This can be useful when you want to point to a new VMware Tools version when for example a security vulnerability in identified VMware Tools. This is recently happened and described in the VMSA-2021-0013 security advisory (link ) for example.&#xA;Requirements: - VMware ESXi 6.</description>

I read the documentation and the procedure described looks still the same as in version 6.x. First patch the witness node, then the passive node, failover the active node, and patch the passive node using the software-packages tool. The whole process is described in this link .&#xA;When I tried to stage the ISO on the witness node the following error occurred:</description>

      <description>For a Disaster Recovery (DR) site, I designed a separate isolated VMware Horizon environment. The vCenter Server has an external (eth0) and internal (eth1) IP address. The external connection is for management and restoring production VMs to the DR environment. The internal connection is for Horizon infrastructure components that need access to the vCenter Server such as a VMware Horizon Server and VMware App Volumes. This looks simplified as follows:</description>

      <description>In this part of the NAKIVO Backup &amp;amp; Replication review I highlight the replication feature. With the replication feature you can replicate VMs. The source VMs are copied, a VM replica is created of each and replicated to the target VMware environment (also known as the recovery site).&#xA;VM Replication protects for example against the following type of disasters:&#xA;Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, tornados etc.) Data center problems such as power losses, fire and water damage Hardware problems such as host, network and storage failures Human errors VM failures caused by updates or patches, virus or manually removal The replication feature can be used for business continuity as part of you&amp;rsquo;re disaster recovery plan.</description>

      <description>To monitor and manage VMware Virtual Machine Snapshots Opvizor has released a tool called Snapwatcher. As consultant I see often that admins don’t have an overview of all the snapshots that exists in their environment. The main concerns with Virtual Machine snapshots are:&#xA;Snapshots are created and forgot to remove Snapshots can very quickly grow in size Snapshots filling datastore space Delta files may cause decreased Virtual Machine and host performance In this review Opvizor Snapwatcher is tested.</description>

      <description>Last week I did a VMware vSphere and VMware View 4 to 5 upgrade. The ESXi servers for the VMware View environment uses Fusion-IO (HP IO Accelerators) PCI flash cards for there non-persistent VDI pools. After the upgrade to vSphere 5.1 I imported the latest Fusion-IO drivers and created a baseline in vSphere Update Manager (VUM) and deployed the new drivers to the cluster.&#xA;After the installation of the Fusion-IO drivers on the ESXi hosts, the Fusion-IO card was not listed in the vSphere (Web) client.</description>

      <description>With vCenter Single Sign-On (SSO) 5.5 there is no requirement for a SQL database anymore. SSO 5.5 uses a own VMware Directory Service (VMdir) database. So after the upgrade to SSO 5.5, the Single Sign-On 5.1 database and users can be removed. This is a manual process. In SQL Management Studio remove the SSO (RSA) database and the “ RSA_DBA” and “ RSA_USER” users created.</description>

      <description>For VMware Horizon View it is recommends that you configure your VMware View Horizon Servers with a signed SSL certificate. Default when you install a VMware View Horizon servers, a certificate is generated that is not signed by a CA. Because it is not signed by a CA It is possible to to intercept traffic. So it is highly recommend to replace the default certificate with a signed certificate after the installation.</description>

      <description>A security server is a special instance of View Connection Server that runs a subset of View Connection Server functions. You can use a security server to provide an additional layer of security between the internet and your internal network. A security server resides within a DMZ and acts as a proxy host for connections inside your trusted network.&#xA;Setting up a VMware Horizon View Security server can be a challenging task because you have to deal with firewalls and some ports that’s need to be opened between the servers.</description>

It’s handy to know what VMs are restarted.&#xA;In the vCenter client the Tasks and Events page size can be increased. Default the vCenter client displays 100 tasks and events. In a cluster with a lot of host and a HA action the 100 tasks and events can be to low.</description>

      <description>When trying to delete an “old” VMDK file, I’ve got the following message “device or resource is busy”. I was pretty sure that the VMDK was not connected to any VM(s) anymore. I tried to delete the VMDK by command line and by using the datastore browser. I found the VMware KB article “Virtual machine does not power on because of locked files” This KB article describes how to find the VMware ESX host that holds the lock.</description>

      <description>Not all servers nowadays have a DVD player installed. Sometimes it is handy to boot from USB and installing a single VMware ESXi server. Here’s a example how to make the USB stick bootable and install VMware ESXi 4.1 from it by using Windows.&#xA;Preparation:&#xA;Need 1GB USB memory stick or more. Download the VMware ESXi 4.1 ISO named VMware-VMvisor-Installer-4.1.0-260247.x86_64.iso (In this example I used the VMware vSphere Hypervisor version). Update: The latest version of VMware ESXi is 4.</description>

The reason turned out to be an odd quirk in querying some types of network adapters, so many people weren&amp;rsquo;t affected at all. On the other hand, if you were affected, it was pretty annoying. To address this we&amp;rsquo;ve released Update 1 of our toolkit .</description>

      <description>Healthcheck is a PowerShell script that reports information like snapshots, VMware tools version, datastore space, CDROM and/or floppy drives connected etc. to HTML and e-mail the output to a person or distribution list.&#xA;Reason for creating this script:&#xA;As VMware Consultant I see a lot of common problems in VMware environments like:&#xA;Snapshots are enabled and forgot Datastores are almost full (for example if snapshots are enabled) VMware tools versions are different CDROM and floppy drives are still mounted to the VM Virtual Machines have CPU and Memory limits or reservations (VMs are swapping) In the VM, the VMware Tools timesync option is not enabled In the Virtual Infrastructure Client (VIC) it is difficult to see this sort of information.</description>

      <description>I see a lot of environments where the Virtual Machine (VM) disk space must be extended.&#xA;Prior ESX 3.5 the way to extend a VDMK was to use the vmkfstools command with the -X parameter from the VMware ESX server console. With the coming of ESX 3.5 it is possible to extend the VMDK file when the VM was shutdown. Now with VMware ESX 3.5 Update 2 it is possible to online (hot) extend the VMDK file.</description>
