In the vCenter Server Appliance Administration section under Certificate Management, you can see the expired certificates.
Cleaning up expired root certificates from the vCenter Server can be done by using the &amp;ldquo;vecs-cli&amp;rdquo; command on the vCenter Server Appliance (In the vSphere Client this is not possible). This involves multiple steps (VMware KB ). An easy way to clean up expired root certificates is by using PowerCLI and following the steps below:</description></item><item><title>Blue circle in the vSphere client after upgrading to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 2</title><link>/2019/04/24/blue-circle-in-the-vsphere-client-after-upgrading-to-vcenter-server-6-7-update-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:02:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/04/24/blue-circle-in-the-vsphere-client-after-upgrading-to-vcenter-server-6-7-update-2/</guid><description>After upgrading the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) to version 6.7 Update 2, I tried to log in using the vSphere Client. After entering the credentials an endless blue running circle appears.
In the VAMI interface (https://vcsa-fqdn:5480) of the VCSA, the health statistics of all the components are green (okay) so I decided to reboot the VCSA.
After the VCSA reboot I encountered the same blue running circle when trying to log in using the vSphere Client.</description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) automated/unattended deployment</title><link>/2018/08/20/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-automated-unattended-deployment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 09:54:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/08/20/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-automated-unattended-deployment/</guid><description>Installing the vCenter Server Aplliance (vCSA) automatically using an unattended scripted deployment can be done by command line (CLI) in combination with a JSON config file. In this example an embedded vCenter Server Appliance with the Platform Service Controller (PSC) and vCenter Server role will be deployed.

This example is based on a Windows Operating System. Using a Linux or MAC OS is also possible but not highlighted in this blog.</description></item><item><title>Top vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) troubleshooting commands</title><link>/2018/03/06/top-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-troubleshooting-commands/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 14:17:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/03/06/top-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-troubleshooting-commands/</guid><description>During the configuration and troubleshooting of vCenter Server Appliances (VCSA) I maintain a list of commands that I frequently use.

The Platform Service Controller (PSC) is configured as VMCA subordinate CA. When opening the vSphere Web/HTML5 Client, Firefox displays the following warning: Your connection is not secure.
This is because Firefox does not trust root certificates in the Windows certificate store. Since Firefox 49 a new option is included which allows Firefox to trust root certificates.</description></item><item><title>The new way to patch the vCenter Server Appliance 6</title><link>/2015/07/30/the-new-way-to-patch-the-vcenter-server-appliance-6/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 09:26:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/07/30/the-new-way-to-patch-the-vcenter-server-appliance-6/</guid><description>The patching process in vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) version 6 is changed from previous versions.

One of the limitations with VCSA 5.1 was that the embedded vPostgres database only supports 5 hosts and 50 VMs. So it was only supported in test and very small environments.
Now with vSphere 5.5 the the embedded vPostgres database of the vCenter Server Appliance supports 500 hosts and 5000 VMs. This is a great improvement!</description></item><item><title>Allocate a static IP address to the VMware vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA)</title><link>/2013/01/14/allocate-a-static-ip-address-to-the-vmware-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 21:15:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/01/14/allocate-a-static-ip-address-to-the-vmware-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa/</guid><description>When deploying the VMware vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) it will default look for a DHCP address.
