You can use a security server to provide an additional layer of security between the internet and your internal network. A security server resides within a DMZ and acts as a proxy host for connections inside your trusted network.
Setting up a VMware Horizon View Security server can be a challenging task because you have to deal with firewalls and some ports thatâ€™s need to be opened between the servers.</description></item></channel></rss>
