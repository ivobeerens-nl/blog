      <description>I see a lot of vCenter Servers that have expired root certificates. In the vCenter Server Appliance Administration section under Certificate Management, you can see the expired certificates.&#xA;Cleaning up expired root certificates from the vCenter Server can be done by using the &amp;ldquo;vecs-cli&amp;rdquo; command on the vCenter Server Appliance (In the vSphere Client this is not possible). This involves multiple steps (VMware KB ). An easy way to clean up expired root certificates is by using PowerCLI and following the steps below:</description>

      <description>In some managed VMware Horizon environments, I wanted to know the highest concurrent users per month. This information can be found in the Horizon Administrator Console under Settings -&amp;gt; Product Licensing and Usage -&amp;gt; Usage.&#xA;Using the VMware Horizon Administrator console is a manual task. I wanted to automate this. To automated this use VMware PowerCLI which supports access to the View API.&#xA;To automate retrieve thehighest concurrent users per month perform the following steps:</description>

      <description>VMware Tools releases have been decoupled from VMware vSphere release since version 10.0. You can now standardize to the latest VMware Tools by configuring a centralized repository. This can be useful when you want to point to a new VMware Tools version when for example a security vulnerability in identified VMware Tools. This is recently happened and described in the VMSA-2021-0013 security advisory (link ) for example.&#xA;Requirements: - VMware ESXi 6.</description>

      <description>On my GitHub page (link ), I uploaded a PowerShell script that identifies all the active parent VM and snapshot per VMware Horizon pool. The parent VM is also known as Golden image.&#xA;With this script, you can quickly identify what parent VMs and snapshots are in use.</description>

      <description>PowerCLI is a must-have tool for every VMware Administrator when you want to automate something in your VMware environment. In this blog, I highlight the installation, updating, and some troubleshooting tips for deploying and running PowerCLI on Windows OSes.&#xA;PowerCLI installation Uninstall PowerCLI 6.x and earlier from the Add/remove programs or Programs and Features if exist. Make sure you have an internet connection. Check if Windows Management Framework 5.1 is installed for Windows 7,8 and Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier OSes.</description>

      <description>Yesterday VMware released a Knowledge Base article that VMware Tools version 10.3.0 is recalled because issues with the VMXNET3 network driver for Windows on ESXi 6.5. The issues can cause a Purple Diagnostic Screen (PSOD) or guest network connectivity loss. Because of these issues, VMware Tools 10.3.0 is recalled and no longer available.&#xA;Update: September 12, 2018: VMware Tools 10.3.2. is released that fixes the VMXNET3 issue.

      <description>Last week i did my first vMotion between two vCenter Servers with different SSO domain by using PowerCLI. This functionality is also known as “cross vCenter vMotion” and is not included in the vSphere Web Client yet. Without downtime it’s possible to live migrate VMs from one vCenter Server to another. Cool stuff!&#xA;Before starting the following requirements must be met:&#xA;VMware vSphere 6.0 and later for the source and destination environment PowerCLI 6.</description>

      <description>PowerCLI 6.0 R1 is released with some cool new features. One thing I missed in this announcement is improvements in the PowerCLI support for VMware Horizon View. The latest release of VMware Horizon View 6.1 still has NO PowerCLI improvements! This is a huge bummer because PowerCLI is very limited in VMware Horizon View.&#xA;On the VMware PowerCLI Blog the following statement is written (link ):&#xA;Each new release tends to have several features or enhancements that have been asked for by YOU, our customers.</description>

      <description>VIBSearch is a simple PowerShell script with a GUI that will search for a specified VIB or all the VIBS installed on the ESXi hosts. A VIB stands for vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB). VIBs are used to package and distribute ESXi software such as drivers. The GUI is designed with SAPIEN PowerShell Studio 2014.&#xA;With VIBSearch it is easily to verify that all the ESXi host in the cluster have the same VIB versions installed.</description>

      <description>For a VMware View Horizon Healthcheck I needed to display all VMware View Pools created and export some settings for documentation. The easiest way to do this is using View PowerCLI on a VMware View Connection server.&#xA;Here are some examples to use:&#xA;Display all the pools and settings: get-pool&#xA;Display the pools with selected fields in table form:&#xA;Get-pool | select DisplayName,Pool_ID,Enabled,MinimumCount,MaximumCount,HeadroomCount,Persistence,Pooltype,Protocol | FT -AutoSize&#xA;Display the some fields in table form and export the pool information to a a text file:</description>

      <description>I create a simple PowerCLI script that backups all the VMware ESXi host configurations that are connected to a vCenter Server. This script can be scheduled to make for example every week a backup of the ESXi server configs. You can easily customize the script for your own needs.&#xA;#Variables $Folder = &amp;#34;D:\Backup\BCK-ESXi&amp;#34; $FolderOld = &amp;#34;D:\Backup\BCK-ESXi\_old&amp;#34; $vc= &amp;#34;vcenterserver-fqdn&amp;#34; # Connect to local vCenter Server Connect-ViServer # Move existing backup files to the old directory Move-Item ($Folder + &amp;#34;\*.</description>

      <description>VMware Horizon View generates everyday at 5 minutes for midnight an event how many concurrent users connected to View that day. This information can be useful for example when when investing trends.&#xA;When the Event database in the VMware Horizon View Administrator is configured, this information can be found using the VMware Horizon View Administrator, Monitoring, select Events and filter for “over the past”&#xA;With PowerCLI the daily maximum concurrent connected users can be displayed by using the following command from the VMware View Connection server using View PowerCLI:</description>
