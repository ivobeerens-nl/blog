This year 754 people (including me) are awarded with the vExpert 2014 title.
Each of these vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others.
This is the fourth time I got the vExpert award. I would like to thank John Troyer, Corey Romero and the rest of the VMware Social &amp;amp; Community Team for making this possible.</description></item><item><title>vExpert 2012</title><link>/2012/04/16/vexpert-2012/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2012 06:49:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2012/04/16/vexpert-2012/</guid><description>Yesterday the 2012 vExpert awards are announced.
