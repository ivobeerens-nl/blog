On Social media and the community ESXi on ARM is a very hot topic. The ESXi ARM fling makes it possible to run the VMware ESXi hypervisor on ARM platforms such as:</description></item><item><title>Using the Shuttle SH370R6 plus as home lab server</title><link>/2019/01/30/home-lab-extension-with-a-shuttle-sh370r6-plus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 11:32:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2019/01/30/home-lab-extension-with-a-shuttle-sh370r6-plus/</guid><description>For my home lab I needed a new host that replaces my Intel NUC (link ) that act as management host. The hardware resources (CPU and memory) on the NUC were limiting my lab activities.
I had the following requirements for the new home lab host:
Ability to run the latest VMware ESXi 6.</description></item><item><title>Slow network throughput between Ubiquiti EdgeRouter VLANs</title><link>/2018/06/04/slow-network-throughput-between-ubiquiti-edgerouter-vlans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:32:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/06/04/slow-network-throughput-between-ubiquiti-edgerouter-vlans/</guid><description>After putting my NAS in a separate storage VLAN I noticed that my network throughput was slow to and from the NAS. The throughput of a simple file copy from a windows laptop (wired at 1 GbE) to a SMB share on the NAS was only 17,7 MB. The Windows laptop was on a different VLAN then the NAS.</description></item><item><title>The mobile SDDC and EUC lab environment</title><link>/2016/06/23/sddc-mobile-lab-environment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 09:46:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2016/06/23/sddc-mobile-lab-environment/</guid><description>With my company I work for (Ictivity ), we decided to develop a mobile Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) and End User Computing (EUC) lab environment. This mobile lab environment will be used to demo the VMware SDDC and End User Computing (EUC) stack with integration of third party solutions. One of the reasons to use a physical lab environment instead of cloud services was flexibility and having no dependencies.</description></item><item><title>New whitebox for extending my home lab</title><link>/2015/01/05/new-whitebox-extending-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 11:48:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2015/01/05/new-whitebox-extending-home-lab/</guid><description>For a couple of months I’m searching for an extra whitebox host for extending my home lab environment. My current lab whitebox is a Haswell based whitebox (see: link). Here is an overview of the new lab environment:
For the new whitebox I had the following requirements:
Hardware such as NICs must be recognized by VMware ESXi Use 32 GB memory or more Low power consumption Expandable Small form factor Quiet Possibility to run nested hypervisors such as VMware ESXi and Hyper-V Remote Management Possibility to create a VMware Cluster and use vMotion, HA, DRS and DPM with the existing Haswell host I reviewed the following popular home lab systems:</description></item><item><title>Haswell low power whitebox for ESXi and Hyper-V</title><link>/2013/06/25/haswell-low-power-whitebox-for-esxi-and-hyper-v/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2013 16:12:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2013/06/25/haswell-low-power-whitebox-for-esxi-and-hyper-v/</guid><description>I was searching for a new whitebox for my home lab.
