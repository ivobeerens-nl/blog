      <description>Shortly after VMworld 2020, VMware released (after years of announcing and demoing) the ESXi On ARM fling (*1). On Social media and the community ESXi on ARM is a very hot topic. The ESXi ARM fling makes it possible to run the VMware ESXi hypervisor on ARM platforms such as:&#xA;Avantek Workstation and server (Ampere eMAG) Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A and HR350A (Ampere eMAG) SolidRun Honeycomb LX2 Raspberry Pi (rPi) 4b model (4GB and 8GB only).</description>

      <description>For my home lab I needed a new host that replaces my Intel NUC (link ) that act as management host. The hardware resources (CPU and memory) on the NUC were limiting my lab activities.&#xA;I had the following requirements for the new home lab host:&#xA;Ability to run the latest VMware ESXi 6.7 U1 version Support for 64 GB memory Fast storage support (M.2 NVMe SSD) Room for PCI-Express add-on cards Run nested environments Low power consumption Limited budget (around 1300 euro).</description>

      <description>After putting my NAS in a separate storage VLAN I noticed that my network throughput was slow to and from the NAS. The throughput of a simple file copy from a windows laptop (wired at 1 GbE) to a SMB share on the NAS was only 17,7 MB. The Windows laptop was on a different VLAN then the NAS.&#xA;After some troubleshooting I noticed that the throughput within the VLAN was okay (120 MB/s on a 1 GbE network).</description>

      <title>The mobile SDDC and EUC lab environment</title>

      <description>With my company I work for (Ictivity ), we decided to develop a mobile Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) and End User Computing (EUC) lab environment. This mobile lab environment will be used to demo the VMware SDDC and End User Computing (EUC) stack with integration of third party solutions. One of the reasons to use a physical lab environment instead of cloud services was flexibility and having no dependencies.</description>

      <title>New whitebox for extending my home lab</title>

      <description>For a couple of months I’m searching for an extra whitebox host for extending my home lab environment. My current lab whitebox is a Haswell based whitebox (see: link). Here is an overview of the new lab environment:&#xA;For the new whitebox I had the following requirements:&#xA;Hardware such as NICs must be recognized by VMware ESXi Use 32 GB memory or more Low power consumption Expandable Small form factor Quiet Possibility to run nested hypervisors such as VMware ESXi and Hyper-V Remote Management Possibility to create a VMware Cluster and use vMotion, HA, DRS and DPM with the existing Haswell host I reviewed the following popular home lab systems:</description>

      <description>I was searching for a new whitebox for my home lab. I had the following requirements for the new whitebox:&#xA;Low power consumption for 24x7 running &amp;gt;16 GB memory Expansion slots for PCI(-E) cards Good performance Low noise A couple of weeks ago Intel released the new 4th generation Haswell CPUs that consumes less power. Seems to be interesting option for building a low power consumption whitebox. So I did some research and ordered the following hardware components:</description>

      <title>Control (remotely) the power of your Home Lab</title>

      <description>I have a lab at home to test for example VMware vSphere and Microsoft stuff. Running your home lab for 24/7 will result in a high electricity bill. For a couple of months I use the Internet Control Station ICS-1000 (ICS-1000) to power on my home lab when needed from anywhere. The ICS-1000 controls (left picture) controls the receivers (right picture). The ICS-1000 is connected to my router. In the receivers are the power cables plugged from the devices you manage.</description>
