      <description>While upgrading a vCenter Server 6.7 to version 7 Update 3 using the vCenter Server 7 UI installer, I was not able to select a datastore for installing the new vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA).&#xA;The datastore selection was blank as shown in the following image.&#xA;This issue still exists in the vCenter Server 7 UI installer.&#xA;Here are the steps to solve this:&#xA;Go to the %appdata% folder (it opens the C:\Users&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\AppData\Roaming folder) Delete the installer folder.</description>

      <description>vSphere 7 is built for supporting modern applications and the hybrid cloud. In the coming years, enterprises will build more and more applications using cloud-native tools and methods. There is a lot more complexity in deploying and managing modern applications. vSphere 7 with Kubernetes (formerly known as Project Pacific) is based on VMware Cloud Foundation 4 (VCF) and will help with this complexity. The developer doesn’t need to deal with infrastructure anymore and the VI Admin can provision and manage the infrastructure workloads with the same tools they already known.</description>

      <description>Last week VMware launched vSphere 6.7. In this blog post I show how easy it is to upgrade a vCenter Server 6.x appliance to a new vCenter Server 6.7 appliance using the graphical interface (GUI) upgrade. The GUI upgrade uses a two stage process:&#xA;Stage 1: Deploy a new vCenter Server 6.7 appliance Stage 2: Transfer the services and configuration data from the old to the new appliance Upgrading the vCenter Server Appliance includes deploying a new appliance (version 6.</description>

      <description>Last week i did my first vMotion between two vCenter Servers with different SSO domain by using PowerCLI. This functionality is also known as “cross vCenter vMotion” and is not included in the vSphere Web Client yet. Without downtime it’s possible to live migrate VMs from one vCenter Server to another. Cool stuff!&#xA;Before starting the following requirements must be met:&#xA;VMware vSphere 6.0 and later for the source and destination environment PowerCLI 6.</description>

      <description>vSphere 6.5 Update 1 is the first major update after the GA release of vSphere 6.5. Besides great new improvements such as vSAN 6.6.1 some nasty bugs are fixed. Here’s a short list you want to know before upgrading to vSphere 6.5 Update 1:&#xA;Upgrade from vSphere 6.0 Update 3 is now a supported upgrade path to vSphere 6.5. Customers who are still on vSphere 5.5 will need to be on at least vSphere 5.</description>

      <description>Last week vSphere 6.5 was released (GA). This release has a lot of new cool features (see this link for more information). In the past I saw vSphere environments that are upgraded without proper preparation resulting in a rollback because compatibility issues with hard-or software. So I created a simple list with steps to check before upgrading to vSphere 6.5:&#xA;Check the hardware against the VMware Compatibility Guide, link There is a PowerCLI script to check the hardware against the VMware Compatibility Guide, link Devices deprecated and unsupported in ESXi 6.</description>

      <description>To monitor and manage VMware Virtual Machine Snapshots Opvizor has released a tool called Snapwatcher. As consultant I see often that admins don’t have an overview of all the snapshots that exists in their environment. The main concerns with Virtual Machine snapshots are:&#xA;Snapshots are created and forgot to remove Snapshots can very quickly grow in size Snapshots filling datastore space Delta files may cause decreased Virtual Machine and host performance In this review Opvizor Snapwatcher is tested.</description>

      <description>Last week I did a VMware vSphere and VMware View 4 to 5 upgrade. The ESXi servers for the VMware View environment uses Fusion-IO (HP IO Accelerators) PCI flash cards for there non-persistent VDI pools. After the upgrade to vSphere 5.1 I imported the latest Fusion-IO drivers and created a baseline in vSphere Update Manager (VUM) and deployed the new drivers to the cluster.&#xA;After the installation of the Fusion-IO drivers on the ESXi hosts, the Fusion-IO card was not listed in the vSphere (Web) client.</description>

      <description>With vCenter Single Sign-On (SSO) 5.5 there is no requirement for a SQL database anymore. SSO 5.5 uses a own VMware Directory Service (VMdir) database. So after the upgrade to SSO 5.5, the Single Sign-On 5.1 database and users can be removed. This is a manual process. In SQL Management Studio remove the SSO (RSA) database and the “ RSA_DBA” and “ RSA_USER” users created.</description>

      <description>After configuring the network portion for your ESXi servers you need to test if the redundancy is working as accepted. From the ESXi layer you can bringing down/up one or more uplinks to test the network resilience. No longer you need to pull out the UTP cables. Since ESXi5 this can be done by using the esxcli network nic down/up command.&#xA;First log in to ESXi using for example using Tech Support Mode</description>

      <description>About a year ago VMware introduced the vRAM entitlement (see post VMware vSphere 5 Licensing explained ). Today at VMworld 2012, VMware announced the end of the vRAM entitlement in VMware vSphere 5 and 5.1!&#xA;In vSphere 5 and 5.1 the licensing will be per physical processor. Each physical processor needs to have at least one vSphere 5 license key assigned. The vSphere licensing removes restrictions on:&#xA;physical cores RAM number of VMs Removing the vRAM entitlement makes it possible to scale up VMware vSphere hosts without buying extra vSphere licenses!</description>

With the X79 chipset it is possible to install 64GB of memory (8 x 8 GB). Because the 8 GB DIMMs are expensive on the moment, I decided to use 8 x 4GB DIMMs (total 32GB).&#xA;I decided to create one physical host for testing VMware vSphere 5, vCloud Director, VMware SRM, VMware View 5 etc.</description>

      <description>When using a whitebox lab environment at home and like to test for example vSphere 5, vCloud Director, VMware View and MS Hyper-V (nested in VMware vSphere you need a lot of processor power and memory.

      <description>When VMware High Availability(HA) comes in action, the VMs are restarted (depending on the HA settings) on other VMware ESX servers in the cluster. It’s handy to know what VMs are restarted.&#xA;In the vCenter client the Tasks and Events page size can be increased. Default the vCenter client displays 100 tasks and events. In a cluster with a lot of host and a HA action the 100 tasks and events can be to low.</description>

Download the VMware ESXi 4.1 ISO named VMware-VMvisor-Installer-4.1.0-260247.x86_64.iso (In this example I used the VMware vSphere Hypervisor version).
