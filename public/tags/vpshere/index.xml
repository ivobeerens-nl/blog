Enter the FQDN name in Windows Server Domain field (1) Enter the user@domain_FQDN in the username field (2) I used the NetBIOS domain name in the “Windows Server Domain” field and “domain\username” in the username field what doesn’t work with Windows 2008 R2 and Windows 7 anymore.</description></item><item><title>Unable to delete a VMDK because it&amp;rsquo;s locked</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2011/03/30/unable-to-delete-a-vmdk-because-its-locked/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 10:16:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2011/03/30/unable-to-delete-a-vmdk-because-its-locked/</guid><description>When trying to delete an “old” VMDK file, I’ve got the following message “device or resource is busy”.
