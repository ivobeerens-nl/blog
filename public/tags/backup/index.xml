      <description>Nakivo Backup and Replication released last week version 10. I personally use Nakivo Backup and Replication in my lab environment because it can be installed on my NAS device. This saves me hardware resources of the backup VM (appliance or Windows/Linux) and the deployment is super fast.&#xA;In version 10 of Nakivo Backup and Replication the following new improvements are added:&#xA;VMware vSphere 7 support. vSphere 7 support for Nakivo Backup &amp;amp; Replication.</description>

      <description>In the last part of the NAKIVO Backup &amp;amp; Replication review I highlight the Multi-Tenancy option, licensing and the final conclusion.&#xA;Multi-Tenancy and branding NAKIVO supports multi-tenancy to deliver Backup-as-a-Service (BAAS) and Disaster-Recovery as a Service (DRaas). The tenants are isolated from each other and cannot access other tenants. Each tenant can access their own environment through a self-service portal and perform all data protection of recovery tasks.&#xA;For each tenant custom branding can be used.</description>

      <description>In this part of the NAKIVO Backup &amp;amp; Replication review I highlight the replication feature. With the replication feature you can replicate VMs. The source VMs are copied, a VM replica is created of each and replicated to the target VMware environment (also known as the recovery site).&#xA;VM Replication protects for example against the following type of disasters:&#xA;Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, tornados etc.) Data center problems such as power losses, fire and water damage Hardware problems such as host, network and storage failures Human errors VM failures caused by updates or patches, virus or manually removal The replication feature can be used for business continuity as part of you&amp;rsquo;re disaster recovery plan.</description>

      <description>In this part of the NAKIVO Backup &amp;amp; Replication review the backup and recovery options will be highlighted.&#xA;Backup To begin with backup and recovery we first need a backup job. Configuring a backup job contains the following five steps:&#xA;1. VMs: Select the VMs to backup from the inventory of the vCenter Server or ESXi host. 2. Destination: Select the destination to store the VMs. Select the onboard repository with deduplication and compression enabled for storage space savings.</description>

      <description>I create a simple PowerCLI script that backups all the VMware ESXi host configurations that are connected to a vCenter Server. This script can be scheduled to make for example every week a backup of the ESXi server configs. You can easily customize the script for your own needs.&#xA;#Variables $Folder = &amp;#34;D:\Backup\BCK-ESXi&amp;#34; $FolderOld = &amp;#34;D:\Backup\BCK-ESXi\_old&amp;#34; $vc= &amp;#34;vcenterserver-fqdn&amp;#34; # Connect to local vCenter Server Connect-ViServer # Move existing backup files to the old directory Move-Item ($Folder + &amp;#34;\*.</description>
