A VIB stands for vSphere Installation Bundle (VIB). VIBs are used to package and distribute ESXi software such as drivers. The GUI is designed with SAPIEN PowerShell Studio 2014.
With VIBSearch it is easily to verify that all the ESXi host in the cluster have the same VIB versions installed.</description></item></channel></rss>
