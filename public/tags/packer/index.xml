The answer is YES. The Packer plugin that makes this possible is called “Hyperv”. Version 1.1.1 supports TPM. Enabling TPM in the Hyper-V VM makes it possible to install Windows 11 without any registry hacks.</description></item><item><title>Build a Windows 10 image with Packer using VMware Workstation</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2022/05/31/build-a-windows-10-image-with-packer-using-vmware-workstation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 20:04:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2022/05/31/build-a-windows-10-image-with-packer-using-vmware-workstation/</guid><description>Most of the time I use Packer against a VMware vSphere and Microsoft Azure environment. But sometimes it’s useful to use VMware Workstation for local testing purposes. For building Windows 10 images with Packer and using VMware Workstation there is not much information available. In this blog post, I show how to build a Windows 10 image with Packer and VMware Workstation.</description></item><item><title>Packer has now virtual TPM (vTPM) device support</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2022/01/27/packer-has-now-virtual-tpm-vtpm-device-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:45:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2022/01/27/packer-has-now-virtual-tpm-vtpm-device-support/</guid><description>In an earlier blogpost called “Use Packer to install Windows 11 and enable vTPM and VBS ” I highlighted a workaround for adding a virtual TPM (vTPM) device to a VM in a VMware vSphere environment. A vTPM device is needed for running Windows 11 (without using registry hacks to bypass the TPM device check).</description></item><item><title>Use Packer to install Windows 11 and enable vTPM and VBS</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2021/10/22/use-packer-to-install-windows-11-and-enable-vtpm-and-vbs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 07:30:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/logbook/site/2021/10/22/use-packer-to-install-windows-11-and-enable-vtpm-and-vbs/</guid><description>I use Packer for building images for VMware VDI environments. With the latest version (when writing this blog Packer version 1.7.7 is the latest version) it is not possible to configure a TPM in the Hashicorp Configuration Languag (HCL) config file. TPM 2.0 is required to install Windows 11. A vTPM emulates a physical TPM 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
