You can see if you have search highlights enabled when having a little drawing in the search bar. When clicking on the search bar it extends with graphics and more crap.

To download the latest Windows ISOs file I use the Windows Media Creation Tool. This is a Windows-based tool. When starting the Windows Media Creation Tool it opens a Graphical User Interface and you are able to download Windows Home (N), Education (N), and the Pro (N) ISO.</description></item><item><title>Quick Tip: The local Windows 10 taskbar is in front during an RDP session</title><link>/2020/10/19/quick-tip-the-local-windows-10-taskbar-is-in-front-during-an-rdp-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 20:03:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2020/10/19/quick-tip-the-local-windows-10-taskbar-is-in-front-during-an-rdp-session/</guid><description>Sometimes it happens to me that the local taskbar of my Windows 10 laptop is in front and you don’t have access to the remote toolbar during a full-screen RDP session.

When there isn’t a GPU (such as NVIDIA M10 or a NVIDIA Tesla T4) installed and hardware acceleration is enabled in the application this can introduce strange problems such as black screens and performance issues.</description></item><item><title>What Windows 10 version for my VDI desktop?</title><link>/2018/10/24/what-windows-10-version-for-my-vdi-desktop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 18:32:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2018/10/24/what-windows-10-version-for-my-vdi-desktop/</guid><description>In a VDI project one of the questions in the design phase is always: “What version I use for my Windows 10 VDI desktop?”. Before Windows 10, the Operating System release cycle was approximate 3 to 5 years.

The error is:
DRIVER_IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (kbdclass.sys).
To fix the problem (The solution was found on the Microsoft Community site, link ):
RDP to the Windows 10 VM Edit HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96B-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\UpperFilters Put the kbdclass before the vmkbd value Reboot the VM After changing the UpperFilters value I was able to login the Horizon View desktop without BSOD.</description></item></channel></rss>
