      <description>The motherboard of my Haswell whitebox contains an Intel I217-V network card. See my “Haswell low power whitebox for ESXi and Hyper-V ” post for more information. The Intel I217-V network card is not recognized by VMware ESXi 5.x by default. On the VMware community I found a post with the Intel I217-V ESXi driver attached. To enable the Intel I217-V network card you have two options:&#xA;Inject the driver in the ESXi ISO using for example the “ESXi-Customizer” tool.</description>

      <description>Recently I had to troubleshoot a VMware View Client connection problem. In a new VMware View environment the customer has installed a VMware Horizon View Security Server for the external connections. When a external View Client tried to connect through the Security Server using the PCoIP protocol to the View desktop the following appeared:&#xA;The connection to the remote computer ended&#xA;When the users connects to the View Desktop using the LAN (without the Security Server) everything worked fine.</description>

      <description>During a health check of a vSphere environment i notices dropped packets on several VMs. In ESXTOP the %DRPRX value showed dropped receive packets on several VMs. In the screenshot an example:&#xA;The customer uses vSphere 4.0 build 244038. All the VMs that experiencing the dropped packets problem were Windows 2008 with an E1000 NIC.&#xA;E1000 — An emulated version of the Intel 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet NIC. A driver for this NIC is not included with all guest operating systems.</description>

      <description>I see a lot of environments where the Virtual Machine (VM) disk space must be extended.&#xA;Prior ESX 3.5 the way to extend a VDMK was to use the vmkfstools command with the -X parameter from the VMware ESX server console. With the coming of ESX 3.5 it is possible to extend the VMDK file when the VM was shutdown. Now with VMware ESX 3.5 Update 2 it is possible to online (hot) extend the VMDK file.</description>
