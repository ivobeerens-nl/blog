      <description>That could be &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo; beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. I had more, but you go ahead. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Calculon is gonna kill us and it&amp;rsquo;s all everybody else&amp;rsquo;s fault!&#xA;I wish! It&amp;rsquo;s a nickel.</description>

      <description>Large bet on myself in round one. Well, thanks to the Internet, I&amp;rsquo;m now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? It&amp;rsquo;s toe-tappingly tragic! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</description>

      <description>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball&amp;rsquo;s in Farnsworth&amp;rsquo;s court! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You&amp;rsquo;d think it would be something you&amp;rsquo;d have to freebase. Look, last night was a mistake.&#xA;Take me to your leader! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</description>

      <description>I just told you! You&amp;rsquo;ve killed me! Do a flip! I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! It&amp;rsquo;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Calculon is gonna kill us and it&amp;rsquo;s all everybody else&amp;rsquo;s fault!&#xA;Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</description>

      <description>Stop it, stop it. It&amp;rsquo;s fine. I will &amp;lsquo;destroy&amp;rsquo; you! Oh God, what have I done? You know, I was God once. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Yeah, lots of people did.&#xA;Kids have names? I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</description>

      <description>Bender, hurry! This fuel&amp;rsquo;s expensive! Also, we&amp;rsquo;re dying! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Now Fry, it&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?&#xA;Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords.</description>
