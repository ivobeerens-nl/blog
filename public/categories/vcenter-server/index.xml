In the vCenter Server Appliance Administration section under Certificate Management, you can see the expired certificates.
Cleaning up expired root certificates from the vCenter Server can be done by using the &amp;ldquo;vecs-cli&amp;rdquo; command on the vCenter Server Appliance (In the vSphere Client this is not possible). This involves multiple steps (VMware KB ). An easy way to clean up expired root certificates is by using PowerCLI and following the steps below:</description></item><item><title>Adding a static route to a vCenter Server with multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/logbook/site/2020/12/15/adding-static-routes-to-a-vcenter-server-with-multiple-network-cards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 13:22:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/logbook/site/2020/12/15/adding-static-routes-to-a-vcenter-server-with-multiple-network-cards/</guid><description>For a Disaster Recovery (DR) site, I designed a separate isolated VMware Horizon environment. The vCenter Server has an external (eth0) and internal (eth1) IP address. The external connection is for management and restoring production VMs to the DR environment. The internal connection is for Horizon infrastructure components that need access to the vCenter Server such as a VMware Horizon Server and VMware App Volumes. This looks simplified as follows:</description></item></channel></rss>
