The answer is YES. The Packer plugin that makes this possible is called “Hyperv”. Version 1.1.1 supports TPM. Enabling TPM in the Hyper-V VM makes it possible to install Windows 11 without any registry hacks.
So I decided to test Packer with Hyper-V and Windows 11 and create a blog post about it.</description></item><item><title>Build a Windows 10 image with Packer using VMware Workstation</title><link>/2022/05/31/build-a-windows-10-image-with-packer-using-vmware-workstation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 20:04:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/05/31/build-a-windows-10-image-with-packer-using-vmware-workstation/</guid><description>Most of the time I use Packer against a VMware vSphere and Microsoft Azure environment. But sometimes it’s useful to use VMware Workstation for local testing purposes. For building Windows 10 images with Packer and using VMware Workstation there is not much information available. In this blog post, I show how to build a Windows 10 image with Packer and VMware Workstation.
With Packer, the VMware-iso builder is used for creating images with VMware Workstation or VMware Fusion.</description></item><item><title>Packer has now virtual TPM (vTPM) device support</title><link>/2022/01/27/packer-has-now-virtual-tpm-vtpm-device-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 19:45:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/01/27/packer-has-now-virtual-tpm-vtpm-device-support/</guid><description>In an earlier blogpost called “Use Packer to install Windows 11 and enable vTPM and VBS ” I highlighted a workaround for adding a virtual TPM (vTPM) device to a VM in a VMware vSphere environment. A vTPM device is needed for running Windows 11 (without using registry hacks to bypass the TPM device check).
The latest Packer Plugin for VMware vSphere (V1.0.3) has now support for adding a vTPM device.</description></item></channel></rss>
