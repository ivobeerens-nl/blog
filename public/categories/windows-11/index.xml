      <description>Some people ask if it is possible to create a Windows 11 VM in Hyper-V with Packer. The answer is YES. The Packer plugin that makes this possible is called “Hyperv”. Version 1.1.1 supports TPM. Enabling TPM in the Hyper-V VM makes it possible to install Windows 11 without any registry hacks.&#xA;So I decided to test Packer with Hyper-V and Windows 11 and create a blog post about it.</description>

      <description>Start Menu management in Windows 11 is different than Windows 10. Microsoft recommended an MDM provider such as Microsoft Intune to manage the Windows 11 Start Menu.&#xA;There are many environments (such as VDI and Azure Virtual Desktop(AVD) that don&amp;rsquo;t use an MDM provider to manage their Windows 11 workspace environment. In this blog post, I will highlight how to manage the Start Menu with native tools such as Active Directory and Group Policies.</description>

      <description>For testing purposes, I frequently use VMware Workstation to install Operating Systems such as Windows 11. The biggest challenge with Windows 11 is that you need a TPM 2.0 device. When installing Windows 11, if your computer does not meet the hardware requirements, you will see a message stating, “This PC can’t run Windows 11“.&#xA;Windows 11 requires the following minimal hardware specifications:&#xA;CPU: 1 GHz or faster with 2 or more cores on the processor RAM: 4 GB RAM Storage: 64 GB or larger Firmware: UEFI, Secure boot TPM: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.</description>

      <title>Disable the little drawing (known as search highlights) in the Windows 10/11 search bar</title>

      <description>After deploying new Windows 10/11 images with the latest updates, Microsoft has included Search highlights. You can see if you have search highlights enabled when having a little drawing in the search bar. When clicking on the search bar it extends with graphics and more crap.&#xA;So what are search highlights?&#xA;Designed to help Windows users discover more information and related content, search highlights present noteworthy, informative, and interesting information of what&amp;rsquo;s special about each day—like holidays, anniversaries, and other moments in time both globally and in your region</description>

      <title>Use Packer to install Windows 11 and enable vTPM and VBS</title>

      <description>I use Packer for building images for VMware VDI environments. With the latest version (when writing this blog Packer version 1.7.7 is the latest version) it is not possible to configure a TPM in the Hashicorp Configuration Languag (HCL) config file. TPM 2.0 is required to install Windows 11. A vTPM emulates a physical TPM 2.0 and is available in VMware vSphere.&#xA;Update: January 27, 2022: Packer with the VMware vSphere plugin ((V1.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote a blog called “Install Windows 11 as VM on VMware vSphere / Workstation without TPM 2.0 chipset“. In this blog article, I explained how to install Windows 11 without having a TPM 2.0 chipset by using a registry hack. Paul Braren from tinkertry.com created a cool video (link) about installing Windows 11 on VMware vSphere using my blog article. Bob Plankers (@plankers) replied on Twitter that virtual TPM can be used too.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Windows 11 is officially released. Windows 11 require a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0 (link). . My VMware ESXi servers at home don’t have a TPM 2.0. During the installation, Windows will check for the presence of a TPM 2.0, if not available the installation will fail. There is a registry hack available to bypass the TPM 2.0 check. Use this only for demo purposes and not in production environments!</description>

      <description>In my lab environment, I use the latest Windows 10 or Windows 11 versions (for example the new Windows 11 23H2) for creating and testing golden images for VDI environments.&#xA;To download the latest Windows ISOs file I use the Windows Media Creation Tool. This is a Windows-based tool. When starting the Windows Media Creation Tool it opens a Graphical User Interface and you are able to download Windows Home (N), Education (N), and the Pro (N) ISO.</description>
