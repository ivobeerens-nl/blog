      <description>When installing a patch on a VMware ESXi host using the ESXCLI command you need to specify the image profile that is available in the ESXi patch.&#xA;Here are the steps for patching a VMware ESXi host with the correct image profile:&#xA;Go to the Customer Connect Patch Downloads page. Download the patch needed, In this example, I use ESXi patch VMware-ESXi-7.0U3o-22348816-depot.zip Upload the patch to a datastore Make a SSH connection to the ESXi host Place the host in maintenance mode esxcli system maintenanceMode set â€“enable-true Now you need to know which image profiles are available in the VMware ESXi patch.</description>

      <description>Lately, I troubleshooted some NIC driver problems in VMware ESXi. During the troubleshooting, I needed to Identify the NIC driver, the software version used, and the latest driver version supported by VMware. Here are the steps outlined.&#xA;Identify the NIC driver and software version: Make an SSH connection to the ESXi host Identify all the NICs by using the following command: esxcli network nic list In this example you can see that Intel (igb) and Broadcom (tg3) NICs are used.</description>
