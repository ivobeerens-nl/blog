      <description>The vExpert 2014 are announced. This year 754 people (including me) are awarded with the vExpert 2014 title.&#xA;Each of these vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others.&#xA;This is the fourth time I got the vExpert award. I would like to thank John Troyer, Corey Romero and the rest of the VMware Social &amp;amp; Community Team for making this possible.</description>
