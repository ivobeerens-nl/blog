The exam has 85 questions and for a non English speaker you get 90 minutes to complete the exam. The passing score is 300 out of 500. The exam has 90 multiple choice/selects questions. The exam is harder than the VCP3 exam, but with proper preparation and experience it’s not that hard.
To prepare the exam i used the list in my previous blog “Resources to prepare for VMware Certified Professional (VCP4) on vSphere 4 ” and I attended the “What’s new” partner training.</description></item><item><title>Resources to prepare for VMware Certified Professional (VCP4) on vSphere 4</title><link>/2009/08/25/resources-to-prepare-for-vmware-certified-professional-on-vsphere-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2009 14:15:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/08/25/resources-to-prepare-for-vmware-certified-professional-on-vsphere-4/</guid><description>There are four possible paths to achieve VCP4 certifiaction:
