ESXi Boot configuration with only SD card or USB drive, without any persistent device, is deprecated with vSphere 7 Update 3. In future vSphere releases, it will be an unsupported configuration!
Move from SD cards and USB devices to local persistent disk(s) such as SATA, SAS (including SATADOM), SSD disks as a boot device for example.</description></item></channel></rss>
