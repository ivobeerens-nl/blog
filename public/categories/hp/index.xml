To see the SAN/iQ version, installed patches and the up-time (thanks to Calvin Zito @HPStorageGuy for guiding me to the up-time counter in CMC)
Here are the steps:
Open the Centralized Management Console (CMC) Login Expand the cluster Expand the Storage Systems Select Diagnostics for the first node (1) Select “Hardware information” (2) Select “Click to refresh” (3) The Storage System Software displays the SAN/iQ version and Software Patches installed: Scroll down to the Stat section and look at the Machine Uptime.</description></item></channel></rss>
