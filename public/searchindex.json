The two most common communicators are:\nssh – An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This communicator is used by Linux winrm – A WinRM connection will be established. This communicator is used by Windows. OpenSSH is available as an Optional Feature in Windows 10 (version 1809 and higher), Windows 11, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022. OpenSSH uses the SSH protocol (port TCP 22) which encrypts all traffic between client and server.\nTo configure the SSH communicator for creating Windows images, follow the steps below.\nPrerequisites\nThe following prerequisites are needed:\nA device running at least Windows Server 2019 or Windows 10 (build 1809). PowerShell 5.1 or later. An account that is a member of the built-in Administrators group. Step 1: Enable SSH in the Windows image\nCreate a PowerShell to install the OpenSSH client and server in the Windows image. OpenSSH enables the SSH protocol. This script is executed during the provisioning of the Windows image in the autounattend.xml file.\nscript name: enable-ssh.ps1\n# Install the OpenSSH Client Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0 # Install the OpenSSH Server Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0 # Start the sshd service Start-Service sshd # Start the SSH service automatic at startup Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType \u0026#39;Automatic\u0026#39; # Confirm the Firewall rule is configured.

Here is an example:\nsource \u0026#34;vSphere-iso\u0026#34; \u0026#34;win10test\u0026#34; { floppy_files = [\u0026#34;${path.root}/scripts/\u0026#34;] // SSH communicator = \u0026#34;ssh\u0026#34; ssh_username = local.SSHUser #add your own SSH username ssh_password = local.SSHPass #add your own SSH password ssh_timeout = \u0026#34;2h\u0026#34; ssh_clear_authorized_keys = \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; } During the deployment of the image, you see when the communicator connects using SSH to the image.\nIf you use Packer for creating Windows and Linux images, only 1 firewall port (TCP 22) needs to be opened when using the SSH communicator.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/2023/12/25/the-latest-technology-news-week-51-2023/","title":"The latest technology news Week 51-2023","description":"","date":"December 25, 2023","image":null,"imageSM":null,"searchKeyword":"","categories":"news","tags":"azure, news, vmware","content":"Welcome to our weekly roundup of the hottest tech updates in the worlds of Azure, VMware, and other partners.

Make sure the Hyper-V role is enabled in Windows 10/11 Download the Windows 11 ISO and save the ISO to the following location: c:\\iso An example of downloading and creating a Windows 10/11 ISO can be found here: https://www.ivobeerens.nl/2021/05/19/quick-tip-download-the-latest-windows-10-iso-file/ Install the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (32-bit version). https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install#download-the-adk-for-windows-11-version-22h2 Add the following location the the system path variable: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Deployment Tools\\x86\\Oscdimg When the prerequisites are met you can go further with the rest. To make it easy I created a PowerShell script called _1.build.ps1 (link ) that does all the work for you.\n# Enable TLS 1.2 [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 # Speed up the invoke-webrequest command $ProgressPreference = \u0026#39;SilentlyContinue\u0026#39; # Variables $downloadfolder = \u0026#34;C:\\temp\\\u0026#34; # Packer location installed $win11_downloadfolder = \u0026#34;C:\\Temp\\packer-main\\hyper-v\\windows11\\\u0026#34; $packer_config = \u0026#34;windows.json.pkr.hcl\u0026#34; #Packer config file $packer_variable = \u0026#34;windows.auto.pkrvars.hcl\u0026#34; # Packer variable file $github = \u0026#34;https://github.com/ibeerens/packer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\u0026#34; $product = \u0026#34;packer\u0026#34; $packer_uri = \u0026#34;https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads\u0026#34; # Check if the temp folder exist If(!(test-path -PathType container $downloadfolder)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $downloadfolder } # Go to the Packer download folder Set-Location $downloadfolder # Download Github files Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $github -OutFile ${downloadfolder}packer.zip Expand-Archive ${downloadfolder}packer.zip -DestinationPath $downloadfolder -Force # Remove zip file Remove-Item -Path ${downloadfolder}packer.zip # Download the latest version of Packer $packurl = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $packer_uri| Select-Object -Expand links | Where-Object href -match \u0026#34;//releases\\.hashicorp\\.com/$product/\\d.*/$product_.*_windows_amd64\\.zip$\u0026#34; | Select-Object -Expand href $packdown = $packurl | Split-Path -Leaf $packdownload = $downloadfolder + $packdown Invoke-WebRequest $packurl -outfile $packdownload # Unzip Packer Expand-Archive $packdownload -DestinationPath $win11_downloadfolder -Force # Remove the Packer ZIP file Remove-Item $packdownload # Go to the Packer download folder Set-Location $win11_downloadfolder Line 7-13: This is the variable block.

When the image is created it is stored and needs to be imported in the Hyper-V manager.\nStart the Hyper-V Manager Select Import Virtual Machine Browse to the created image folder C:\\Temp\\packer-main\\hyper-v\\windows11\\output-windows11\\ Select the VM Register the VM in-place Start the VM On my laptop, I have in 35 minutes a fresh copy of Windows 11 running with the latest updates installed running in Hyper-V. How cool is that!

For example, when I want to test an application, I create a new VM and install the application. When I finish testing I remove the VM with a single command. The VM creation only takes a couple of minutes.\nIn this example, an Azure VM is created using existing Azure resources (Resource Group, VNet, and Subnet) with the following settings:\nA Windows Server 2022 or Windows 11 22H2 Enterprise multi-session VM with the options trusted launch, secure boot, and vTPM enabled The VM has a public and private IP address or only a private IP address When defining a public IP address, a Network Security Group (NSG) is created with an RDP rule that only allows the external IP address A Custom Script Extension that downloads and executes a PowerShell script Automatically Shutdown the VM at a given time After the test completes, the VM is destroyed by Terraform. When creating images (golden images) I use other tools such as Hashicorp Packer for example.\nFile structure In the Terraform file structure, the following files are created:\nterraform.tfvars - The values of the variables are defined in this file. This is the only file that\u0026rsquo;s needed to be modified. variables.tf - Contains all the defined variables. provider.tf - Contains the Azure Cloud provider Terraform communicates with. main.tf - This is the main configuration file for creating the VM In an existing environment, we already have resources that are not managed by Terraform as part of the deployment. In the terraform.tfvars file we can define the names of the existing resources the VM is going to use such as:\nResource Group Region The VNET The Subnet terraform.tfvars In the terraform.tfvars, all the values of the variables are defined. I use comments (single line) and comment blocks with the following syntax:\nSingle line begin with: // Multiple lines: begins with: /* and ends with */ The comment blocks are used for excluding multiple lines from the Terraform files:\nvm_name - The name of the VM vm_rg - An existing Resource Group where the VM resources will be created vnet_rg - An existing VNet resource group vnet_name - An existing VNet name vm_size - VM type vm_username - Local Administrator username tag_environment - Environment tag Operating System\nWindows Server 2022 and Windows 11 22H2 Enterprise multi-session with trusted launch, secure boot, and vTPM enabled are defined. Select one OS.\nWindows 11 22H2 Enterprise Multi-Session\noffer = \u0026#34;Windows-11\u0026#34; publisher = \u0026#34;microsoftwindowsdesktop\u0026#34; sku = \u0026#34;win11-22h2-avd\u0026#34; Windows Server 2022\noffer = \u0026#34;windowsserver\u0026#34; publisher = \u0026#34;microsoftwindowsserver\u0026#34; sku = \u0026#34;2022-datacenter-azure-edition\u0026#34; vm_storage - Type of storage used vm_timezone - Which Timezone is used file_uris - File location of the Custom Script Extension vm_shutdown - VM shutdown time Change the values to your needs.\nPrivate/Public IP address When deploying VMs it is not recommended to give them a public IP address because everyone can connect to the VM from outside the network. But without a VPN connection, you need a public IP for connecting the VM by RDP for example. When deploying a VM with a public IP address make sure to create a Network Security Group (NSG) with an RDP rule that only allows the public IP access to the VM. The cool thing is that the public IP is not hardcoded in the script. A service called https://api.ipify.org will get the public IP address.\nPublic IP address\nIf you have a VPN connection a private IP is sufficient. The following lines can be excluded:\n// Not needed when using a VPN or Bastion public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.public_ip.id and the RDP rule:\n// Not needed when using a VPN or Bastion // NSG Security RDP rule(s) resource \u0026#34;azurerm_network_security_rule\u0026#34; \u0026#34;vm-sec-rule\u0026#34; { access = \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34; destination_address_prefix = \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; destination_port_range = \u0026#34;3389\u0026#34; direction = \u0026#34;Inbound\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;RDP\u0026#34; network_security_group_name = azurerm_network_security_group.vm-nsg.name priority = 100 protocol = \u0026#34;Tcp\u0026#34; resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.vm-rg.name source_address_prefixes = local.authorized_ip_ranges source_port_range = \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; depends_on = [ azurerm_network_security_group.vm-nsg, ] } Custom Script Extension The azurerm_virtual_machine_extension resource, downloads and run a script in the VM as a post-deployment task. As a location, I use my own GitHub repository. In the repository is a PowerShell script that performs the following post-deployment tasks:\nAllow ICMP ping requests to the VM Set the Power Management profile to \u0026ldquo;High Performance\u0026rdquo; Create a c:\\temp folder Set the OS label to OperatingSystem Install the Chocolatey package manager Install Visual Studio Code Install NotePad++ Automatically shutdown With the azurerm_dev_test_global_vm_shutdown_schedule resource, you can control the shutdown time of the VM. This can be useful if you want to stop (deallocated) the VM to save costs. In the terraform.tfvars file, you set the vm_shutdown value.\nCreate the VM To run Terraform, execute step 1 till 3 found here: link First, initialize terraform which downloads the Terraform provider(s) defined:\nterraform init\nThe password is not hardcoded in the terraform.tfvars file. With the Terraform apply command you can set the password for the variable \u0026ldquo;vm_password\u0026rdquo;. The apply option creates a plan and executes this. The \u0026ndash;auto-approve option doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask for confirmation to apply changes:\nterraform apply -var \u0026quot;vm\\_password=ThisisaGoodPassword!\u0026quot; --auto-approve\nAfter a couple of minutes, the VM is created and the private and public IP addresses are displayed as output values.\nDestroying the Windows VM When finishing with testing the VM can be destroyed without destroying the existing resources such as:\nResource Group The VNet The Subnet The following command destroys the VM just created:\nterraform destroy -var \u0026quot;vm\\_password=ThisisaGoodPassword!\u0026quot; --auto-approve\nConclusion This example shows one of the strengths of Terraform. You only need to change a single file (terraform.tfvars) once that includes the values of the variables. With a single command, you create a VM in a couple of minutes, and with a single command, you destroy the VM with all the resources you created. Very powerful!\nThe GitHub repository can be found here: Link "},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/2023/03/07/powercli-cannot-be-installed-or-updated-because-the-authenticode-signature-of-the-file-error/","title":"PowerCLI cannot be installed or updated because the authenticode signature of the file error","description":"","date":"March 7, 2023","image":null,"imageSM":null,"searchKeyword":"","categories":"powercli, VMware","tags":"powercli","content":"On a new Windows Server 2022 VM I tried to install a fresh copy of VMware.PowerCLI (13.0.0) with the following PowerShell command:\nInstall-Module VMware.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser The following error occurred:\nPackageManagement\\Install-Package : The module \u0026lsquo;VMware.VimAutomation.License\u0026rsquo; cannot be installed or updated because the authenticode signature of the file \u0026lsquo;VMware.VimAutomation.License.cat\u0026rsquo; is not valid.

In this blog post, I will highlight how to manage the Start Menu with native tools such as Active Directory and Group Policies.\nI will create several blog posts about how to customize the Windows 11 Start Menu, configure the taskbar, remove unwanted desktop icons and remove bloatware and apps.\nCustomize the Windows 11 Start Menu (this blog post) Customize the Windows 11 Desktop icons Customize the Taskbar icons Remove bloatware from the Start Menu In this blog post, I will highlight how to customize the Windows 11 Start Menu with native Active Directory Group Policies.\nIn Windows 10 you can export and import the Start Menu layout. With the \u0026ldquo;Export-StartLayout\u0026rdquo; PowerShell command, the Start Menu is exported to an XML file. With a Group Policy, you refer to the custom XML file.\nIn Windows 11, the Start Menu is exported to a JSON file. The command is like this:\nExport-StartLayout -Path \u0026#34;C:\\Layouts\\LayoutModification.JSON\u0026#34; There is no Group Policy (Windows 11 22H2) to import a Start Menu JSON file. The Group Policy only works with an XML file. Here is a workaround. In Windows 11 the Start Menu is stored in a single encrypted file in the following folder location:\n%LocalAppdata%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\LocalState In this folder, there is a start.bin or start2.bin (depending on the Windows 11 version) file. This file is the Windows 11 Start Menu that can be copied.\nThese steps will copy the modified Start Menu to a central location and when the endpoint starts the modified Start Menu will be copied to the default user profile. When new users logs in, they will get the customized Start Menu.\nPin/unpin and organize the apps in the Start Menu the way you want. Copy the start2.bin file in from the %LocalAppdata%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\LocalState folder to a central location (for example in a folder in the netlogon share of the domain controller (for example \\lab.local\\netlogon\\w11).

Note:This user-mode component is dependent on the VMCI driver. DeviceHelper The VMware Device Helper component helps to perform a device check and swap in your virtual machine. Note:This user-mode component is dependent on the VMCI driver. Hgfs Hgfs is a VMware shared folders driver that allows files to be shared between your virtual machine and the host computer. You can use this driver, if you plan to use this virtual machine with VMware Workstation, Player, or Fusion. Note: - If you exclude this feature, you cannot share a folder between your virtual machine and the host system. This component is dependent on the VMCI driver. SVGA The VMware SVGA driver enhances the performance of your virtual video card. Note:If you exclude this feature, it limits the display capabilities of your virtual machine. VMXNet The VMware VMXNet networking driver enhances the performance of your virtual network card. VMXNet3 The VMware VMXNet3 networking driver enahnces the performance of your virtual network card (ndis5/ndis6). This is the Next-generation VMware VMXnet networking driver for virtual machines that use virtual hardware version 7 and higher.

VMXNET3 adds several new features, such as multiqueue support (also known as \u0026lsquo;Receive Side Scaling\u0026rsquo; in Windows), IPv6 offloads, and MSI/MSI-X interrupt delivery. VMXNET 3 is not related to VMXNET or VMXNET 2. Receive Side Scaling is enabled by default. VMware Tools 10.3.0 adds receive data ring support for Windows VMXNET3 driver. Virtual hardware version 7 corresponds to ESX/ESXi 4.x compatibility. PVSCSI The VMware Paravirtual SCSI adapters enhances the performance of your paravirtual SCSI devices. EFIFW The EFIFW driver is used for EFI Firmware update. MemCtl The Memory Control Driver provides enahnced memory management of the virtual machine.

This driver is used, if the guest operating system is Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, or other newer operating systems. Linux and older Windows operating systems use the Filesystem Sync driver. BootCamp The BootCamp driver provides Mac BootCamp support. So I decided to install VMware Tools 12 manually and search in the Windows registry for the components:\nAs you can see, the AppDefense component doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist anymore in VMware Tools 12.

Add the VMware vSphere plugin to the HCL configuration file (https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vSphere ) packer { required_version = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;= 0.0.1\u0026#34; required_plugins { vsphere = { version = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;= 0.0.1\u0026#34; source = \u0026#34;github.com/hashicorp/vsphere\u0026#34; } } } Add a variable to enable vTPM variable \u0026#34;vm_tpm\u0026#34; { type = string default = \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; } In the vSphere-iso section, add the vTPM configuration parameter that uses the vm_tpm variable to enable the vTPM device (more options can be found here, link ) source \u0026#34;vSphere-iso\u0026#34; \u0026#34;win11basic\u0026#34; { vTPM = \u0026#34;${var.vm_tpm}\u0026#34; } Perform a packer init command to download the Packer plugin binaries define in the config file packer init config.pkr.hcl Run the packer build command to create the VM packer build config.pkr.hcl The VM will be created with a vTPM device.\nWith Packer and the VMware vSphere plugin, it is now possible to create a VM with a vTPM device which is needed for deploying Windows 11 VMs. This is a great improvement!\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/2021/11/26/identify-the-boot-device-for-a-vmware-esxi-host/","title":"Identify the boot device for a VMware ESXi host","description":"","date":"November 26, 2021","image":null,"imageSM":null,"searchKeyword":"","categories":"vSphere-7","tags":"boot, sd-card, vSphere-7","content":"With vSphere 7 VMware is moving away from supporting SD cards and USB as boot media.

You can now standardize to the latest VMware Tools by configuring a centralized repository. This can be useful when you want to point to a new VMware Tools version when for example a security vulnerability in identified VMware Tools. This is recently happened and described in the VMSA-2021-0013 security advisory (link ) for example.\nRequirements: - VMware ESXi 6.7 Update 1 or later - PowerCLI installed\nHere are the steps to create a central VMware Tools repository:\nCreate a folder structure on a central datastore (all VMware ESXi hosts have access to this datastore) in the cluster. For example: On the nfs01 datastore is created a folder called \u0026ldquo;vmwtools\u0026rdquo;, under that folder, I created another folder called \u0026ldquo;11.3.0-18090558\u0026rdquo; Download the latest VMware Tools version, link Extract the VMware Tools ZIP file. Two folders are extracted: floppies vmtools Upload the two folders to the folder structure created. In this example I used: /vmfs/volumes/vmwtools/11.3.0-18090558 Change the following variables so it matches the vSphere environment: $cluster $datastore The PowerCLI script below will point all the VMware ESXi hosts in a cluster to the central VMware Tools repository location. Execute this script # Import PowerCLI module Import-Module VMware.PowerCLI # VMware VirtualCenter server name $VCserver = read-host \u0026#34;Enter the vCenter server name\u0026#34; # Connect to the vCenter server Connect-VIServer -server $VCserver $cluster = \u0026#39;CL-MGNT\u0026#39; $hosts = Get-Cluster -Name $cluster | Get-VMHost $datastore = \u0026#39;/vmfs/volumes/nfs01/vmwtools/11.3.0-18090558/\u0026#39; # Display current VMware Location $hosts | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name \u0026#34;UserVars.ProductLockerLocation\u0026#34; | Select-Object Entity,Value # Change VMware Tools location Get-cluster -name $cluster | Get-VMhost | %{$_.ExtensionData.UpdateProductLockerLocation($datastore)} # Display current VMware Location $hosts | Get-AdvancedSetting -Name \u0026#34;UserVars.ProductLockerLocation\u0026#34; | Select-Object Entity,Value # Disconnect vCenter Disconnect-VIserver -server * -Confirm:$false The default location of the VMware Tools is: /locker/packages/vmtoolsRepo/\nSelect a Windows VM in the vSphere cluster. A message is displayed that there is a newer version of VMware Tools available. Select Upgrade VMware Tools (It is possible that the VM is automatically rebooted when choosing for an Automatic Upgrade). After the installation, check if VMTools is running and if the version is current. Creating a central VMware Tools repository is an easy step that is very useful to stay up to date with the latest VMware Tools versions for the Virtual Machines.\nThe VMware PowerCLI script listed above can be found on my GitHub repository, link .\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/2021/06/21/run-home-assistant-supervised-as-virtual-machine-vm-on-vmware-esxi/","title":"Run Home Assistant on VMware ESXi","description":"","date":"June 21, 2021","image":null,"imageSM":null,"searchKeyword":"","categories":"home-assistant","tags":"home-assistant","content":"Updated: August 19, 2023.
