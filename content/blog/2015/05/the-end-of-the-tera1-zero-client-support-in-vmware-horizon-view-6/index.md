**(\*2)** Tera1 zero clients are certified on VMware Horizon View 5.3 and earlier. Horizon View 6.x is not supported by VMware. If you require VMware support use VMware Horizon View 5.3 and earlier or upgrade to Tera2 zero clients.

Teradici provides technical support on PCoIP Firmware (FW 4.7.1 and earlier) for Tera1 zero clients with VMware Horizon View 6.0.1 and earlier. Here is an overview of the Teradici End-of-Life (EOL) notifications:

The latest release of VMware Horizon View when written is version 6.1. Both VMware and Teradici don't have support for the Tera1 zero clients in this release.

### **So what options do you have?**

The following options can be used when having Tera1 zero clients:

- Use VMware Horizon View 5.3 or earlier. This options is fully supported by Teradici and VMware.
- Upgrade to View Horizon 6.0.1. This option is only supported by Teradici.
- Use Tera1 zero clients with Horizon View version 6.1. Don't use any new features that are introduced in VMware Horizon View 6 and later. Be sure to test test and test this option, because this isn't supported by VMware and Teradici!
- Buy new Tera2 zero clients. **10ZiG** for example offers a buy-back program for any Tera1 Zero Client when upgrading to Tera2 hardware. It does not matter which brand the Tera1 zero client is. This can reduced the hardware upgrade costs! Tera2 zero clients adds support for the latest version of Horizon View and improves performance. To learn more about the 10ZiG Tera1 buy-back offer, use the following this [link](http://www.pages03.net/10zig/terra1/).

I created a Horizon 6 matrix with the new and  features that aren't supported anymore. The matrix can be found here, [link](http://www.pages03.net/10zig/buyback_page/).
