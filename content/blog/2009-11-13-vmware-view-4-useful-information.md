After attending the VMware View 4 Talkshoe podcast the following information about the announced VMware View 4 was discussed:

### VM’s per core:

> VM’s per core, In VMware View 3 the number was 6-9 VM’s per core, now in View 4 with for example the Intel Nehalem processors you can get to 12-16 VM’s per core. This number heavily depends for example on the application load inside the VM’s.

### The PCoIP protocol does NOT support:

> – Security Server;
> 
> – Smart Cards integration;
> 
> – Thinprint support.

### Generally: 

> – The PCoIP protocol is not different in scalability than RDP;
> 
> – For the RDP protocol version 6 is used in VMware VIEW;
> 
> – Offline desktop support is still experimental;
> 
> – There’s no RTO Software Virtual Profiles in this release of VMware VIEW 4;
> 
> – Windows 7 is still experimental, official support will be around the begin of 2010;
> 
> – The Connection server must be installed on Windows 2003, support for Windows 2008 will be around the begin of 2010;
> 
> – Advise for virus scanning software is use VMware aware virus scanners (VMsafe), for example Trend Micro and McAfee have beta’s that use the VMsafe technology.
