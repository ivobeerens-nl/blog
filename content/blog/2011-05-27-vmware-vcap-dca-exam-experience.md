<font color="#000000">I took the VCAP-DCA (VDCA410) exam on 12 May 2011 at Global Knowledge in Nieuwegein (The Netherlands). Today 27 May 2011 I received an e-mail that I passed the VCAP-DCA exam! Great </font><font color="#000000">news before the weekend!</font>

<font color="#000000"></font>

<font color="#000000">Here are some VCAP-DCA exam requirements:</font>

<font color="#000000">â€“ The exam time is 4 hours (time is for non English speaking countries) </font>

<font color="#000000">â€“ The passing score is 300 out of 500</font>

<font color="#000000">â€“ It takes up to business days 10 days (or more ðŸ™‚ before you know if you passed the exam</font>

â€“ [Scheduling for the VCAP-DCA exam can be done by the Pearson VUEâ€™s website](http://www.pearsonvue.com/vmware)

<font color="#000000">Donâ€™t underestimated the exam, itâ€™s a hard one! I was sweating for four 4 hours and didnâ€™t finished all the questions because the time stops. </font>

<font color="#000000">The exam is all lab based so you need to do stuff as configuring and troubleshooting vSphere environments. You need to compete tasks they asked. The best advise is to create your own test lab environment as mentioned in the exam blueprint. Then use the blueprint and practice the objectives. The VMware PDF documents are available but try to avoid because they cost valuable time. So donâ€™t rely on the PDFs! Go to the toilet before the exam several times till nothing is coming out. After three hours I needed to go but I had no time. Itâ€™s not a good feeling to hold itâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.</font>
