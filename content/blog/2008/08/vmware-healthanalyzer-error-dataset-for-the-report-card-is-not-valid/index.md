I had problems using the VMware HealthAnalyzer on VMware VC 2.5 Update 2. When i try to Create a new Report Card i've got the following message:

Dataset for the report card is not valid. Dataset id=12 ; Datset File Name=/usr/share/ironman/capture/captureFiles/c20080817230624

VMware has confirmed there is a known issue, VMware HealthAnalyzer is not able to parse the version of the SDK correctly and released a fix. The are coming soon with a new version.
