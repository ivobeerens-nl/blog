The Healthcheck Powershell script I wrote for the VMware Powershell scripting contest is on 6th position on the “Top 10 Powershell scripts that VMware administrators should use” from Eric Siebert. Eric is the administrator of the site [VMware-land.com](http://vmware-land.com/) that has the largest VMware link collection on the web.

I was today at the Dutch VMUG event and attended the presentation from Eric Sloof “[Managing VI3 with Powershell](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/804-Eric-Sloof-presented-Managing-VI3-with-PowerShell-at-Dutch-VMUG.html)“. I saw in his presentation that I was on the 6th place. Cool. I think Eric’s presentation was was the best session of the day.
