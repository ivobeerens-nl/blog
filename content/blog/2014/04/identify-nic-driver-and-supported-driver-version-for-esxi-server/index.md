#### Identify the NIC driver and software version:

- Make an SSH connection to the ESXi host
- Identify all the NICs by using the following command: _esxcli network nic list_

- In this example you can see that Intel (igb) and Broadcom (tg3) NICs are used.
- To identify the driver version of the Broadcom NIC (vmnic0) use the following command: _esxcli network nic get -n "vmnic0"_

> driver: **tg3** version: **3.135b.v50.1** firmware-version: **FFV7.6.14 bc 5720-v1.31** bus-info: 0000:01:00.0

#### Identify the latest NIC driver supported by VMware:

- We need to find the hardware IDs of the NIC by using the following command: _vmkchdev -L | grep "vmnic"_

The hardware ID contains the following parts:

> VID = Vendor Id (Red part) DID = Device Id  (Yellow part) SVID = Sub-Vendor Id (Green part) SSID = Sub-Device Id (Blue part)

- Open the VMware Compatibility Guide (HCL) webpage and choose IO Devices, [Link](http://www.VMware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=io)

- On the right you see the “Additional Criteria” column. Enter the VID, DID, SVID, and SSID generated by the “vmkchdev” command

- Click the “Update and View Results” button
- The NIC is displayed, click on the Model

- Download the driver and use VMware Update Manager (VUM) or use “esxcli software vib update” command to install the driver
