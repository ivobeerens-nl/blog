[![altaro](images/altaro_thumb.jpg "altaro")](images/altaro3.jpg) Altaro Software, developers of Altaro [Hyper-V Backup](http://www.altaro.com/hyper-v-backup/), are giving something back this holiday season and are giving every Microsoft Hyper-V admin 50 licenses of their desktop backup software, that’s up to $2,000 worth of software. There’s no catch!

All you need to do is send them a screenshot of Hyper-V that proves that you use Hyper-V and they will send you the licenses which you can use on your own machines or give out to friends, family or colleagues, to use at work or home. The giveaway ends on Dec 24th 2012.
