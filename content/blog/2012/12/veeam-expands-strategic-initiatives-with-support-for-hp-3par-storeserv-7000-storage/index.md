**News Facts:**

- [Veeam Software](http://www.veeam.com/?ad=pr1), innovative provider of backup, replication and virtualization management solutions for VMware vSphere and Windows Server Hyper-V, announces it has expanded integration with HP to include SAN snapshot recovery for HP 3PAR StoreServ 7000 Storage using HP 3PAR Virtual Copy Software. Currently, [Veeam Explorer for SAN Snapshots](http://go.veeam.com/san-snapshot-explorer.html) enables IT administrators to recover virtual machines (VMs) or data directly from HP StoreVirtual Storage snapshots within the Veeam Backup & Replication application. Veeam support for the new 3PAR StoreServ 7000 Storage and all other 3PAR models is expected to become available in the first half of 2013.

- Most industry experts agree that modern data protection should include the use of storage snapshots as part of a comprehensive data protection strategy. Veeam Explorer for SAN Snapshots was created to combine recovery from SAN snapshots and backups into a cohesive, multi-tier solution with no compromises.

        - Recover single files from SAN snapshots in a few minutes.
        - Restore VMs without staging or intermediate steps.
        - Recover an entire VM in two minutes or less.

- **Easy-to-Use**
    - One integrated recovery environment for every recovery scenario.
    - Easy-to-use wizards for recovery of VMs, files and application items.
    - No agents to deploy on hosts or VMs.
