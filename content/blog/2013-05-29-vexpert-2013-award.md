Last night the list of vExperts are announced. On the moment there are named 580 vExperts. For the third year on a row I earned the vExpert award. Iâ€™m honored to be a part of this amazing group of people!

I would like to thank John Troyer, Corey Romero, and the VMware Social Media &amp; Community Team for making this possible.

Congratulations to all the other vExperts! The list of vExperts can be found [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2013/05/vexpert-2013-awardees-announced.html#comment-5939).
