<span style="color: #000000;">The applications are now open for the vExpert 2012 title.</span>

> <span style="color: #000000;">The annual VMware vExpert title is given to individuals who have significantly contributed to the community of VMware users over the past year. The title is awarded to individuals (not employers) for their commitment to sharing their knowledge and passion for VMware technology above and beyond their job requirements.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">This year there are three different paths to becoming a vExpert. Here are the three paths listed:</span>

> <span style="color: #000000;">**Evangelist Path**  
> The Evangelist Path includes book authors, bloggers, tool builders, public speakers, and other IT professionals who share their knowledge and passion with others with the leverage of a personal public platform to reach many people. Employees of VMware can also apply via the Evangelist path.</span>
> 
> <span style="color: #000000;">**Customer Path**  
> The Customer Path is for internal evangelists and community leaders from VMware customer organizations. They have contributed to success stories, customer references, or public interviews and talks, or were active community contributors, such as VMUG leaders. </span>
> 
> <span style="color: #000000;">**VPN (VMware Partner Network) Path**  
> The VPN Path is for employees of our partner companies who lead with passion and by example, who are committed to continuous learning and to making their technical knowledge and expertise available to many. This can take shape of event participation, video, IP generation, as well as public speaking engagements. </span>
