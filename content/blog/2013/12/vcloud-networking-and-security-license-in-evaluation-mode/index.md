This is strange because vSphere 5.1 > includes a vShield Endpoint license. So no extra vShield licenses are required.  I found a [KB](http://kb.VMware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2036875) about vShield Endpoint. It states:

> The vShield Endpoint asset may show up as unlicensed or with an evaluation license in the vCenter Server console, but functionality is fully enabled.

So you don’t have to worry that vShield Endpoint stops working. This is by design and will probably fixed in a later version.
