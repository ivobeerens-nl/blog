A couple of weeks ago my desktop PC died, so my girlfriend could not read there e-mail. I decide to turn my OLD VMware ESX test server into a Microsoft Vista workstation and buy a new whitebox. After searching the internet and comparing components, I found the following configuration:

- – CoolerMaster Centurion 590 mini tower
- – CoolerMaster Real Power 520W modular Power supply
- – Asus P5BP-E/4L (with 4 onboard NICS)
- – Intel Core 2 Quad 6600 Processor Boxed
- – Kingston 8GB 800MHz DDR2 memory
- – Samsung Spinpoint F1 1TB

I had already a LSI Megaraid SATA-4 RAID controller. The whitebox is very quiet. It’s installed with VMware ESX 3i. It performs very good with a couple of VMs. I will benchmark it soon.
