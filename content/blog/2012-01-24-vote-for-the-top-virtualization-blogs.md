On [vSphere-land](http://vsphere-land.com/news/voting-now-open-for-the-top-vmware-virtualization-blogs.html) the yearly voting for the top VMware and virtualization blog(s) is open.

By voting you can reward the bloggers for their hard work and dedication by letting them know that you appreciate them.

You can vote till 7 February 2012, so please take a couple of minutes and vote for your favorite 10 blogs and rank them (if you want to vote for my blog it’s on the left side in the middle). You can win a copy of the Train Signal’s new vSphere 5 and View 5 video training courses.
