By voting you can reward the bloggers for their hard work and dedication by letting them know that you appreciate them.

You can vote till March 3 2013, so please take a minute and vote for your favorite 10 blogs and rank them (if you want to vote for my blog itâ€™s on the left side in the middle). All the blogs are listed on the vLaunchPad page.
