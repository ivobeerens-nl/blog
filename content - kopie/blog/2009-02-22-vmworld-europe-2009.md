Iâ€™m ready for VMworld 2009. I packed my clothes, charge the telephone, laptop, photo camera and the MP3 player.

I go with two colleagues from our company, we fly on tomorrow (Monday) from Rotterdam (The Netherlands) 10.50.

I have made a personal list with the session (and meetings/parties) who got my interest. There are lot interesting hands-on labs but the are not on the session list .
