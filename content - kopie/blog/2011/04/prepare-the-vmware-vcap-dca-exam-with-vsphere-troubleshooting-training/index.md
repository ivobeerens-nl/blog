I'm preparing for the VMware Certified Advanced Professional – Datacenter Administration exam. The exam covers 40 questions about real world stuff like installing, configuring and troubleshooting vSphere environments. So you need hand-on experience on installing, configuring and troubleshooting vSphere environments.

For the preparation I use the Trainsignal VMware vSphere Troubleshooting Training video course presented by David Davis.

The Trainsignal VMware vSphere Troubleshooting Training course covers mainly section 6 of the VCAP-DCA [blueprint](http://mylearn.vmware.com/register.cfm?course=70779) (Perform Advanced Troubleshooting). In 30 high quality video lessons troubleshooting is mainly done by CLI (Command Line Interfaces). Here are some topics that get covered during the course:

- vMA installation and commands
- Configure, viewing, searching and exporting vCenter and VMware ESX(i) log files
- vNetwork Distributed vSwitch (vDS) refresher and private VLANS
- ESXtop / RESXTOP
- Troubleshooting Networks by CLI
- Troubleshooting Storage by CLI (iSCSI and NFS)
- Troubleshooting vCenter
- Configure and troubleshoot ESX firewall
- Troubleshooting VMotion and SVMotion
- Troubleshoot HA and DRS
- Troubleshooting VMs

The vSphere Troubleshooting Training is almost 14 hours, is available on 3 DVDs and online as streaming video (iPad compatible).  The complete course outline is available on the website listed on the end. A sample video is available [here](http://www.vmwarevideos.com/vsphere-troubleshooting-video-how-to-restore-network-vmware-esxi).

The videos are easy to follow. I think the Trainsignal VMware vSphere Troubleshooting Training it’s a great way to prepare and get hands-on experience needed for the VCAP-DCA exam.
