In Augustus I did a blog post ([link](http://localhost/2018/08/27/whats-announced-at-vmworld-2018-us/)) about the announcements made at VMworld 2018 US. This week it’s time for VMworld Europe in Barcelona with 12000 attendees. The vision of VMware is still the same as the last years: **any cloud, any application, any device**.

This will help consolidate and simplify management of global hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.

And specifically, for Horizon 7 on VMware Cloud on AWS, we will be previewing the automated installation of the Horizon 7 infrastructure.
