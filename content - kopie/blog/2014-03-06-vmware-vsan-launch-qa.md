VMware has today announced VSAN. Here are some highlights from the Q&amp;A session:

- VSAN will be GA at March 10 2014
- vSphere 5.5 Update 1 will support VSAN GA
- Beta VSAN upgrades to the GA release are not supported
- VSAN is not a VSA. Performance is much better than any VSA
- Pricing and packaging will covered on the GA date
- Performance of VSAN scales linear as you add more hardware (extra nodes with storage)
- Initial release of VSAN requires SSD and HDD. So using only SSD disks and no HDDs it not possible
- VSAN use cases are for example: VDI, Tier 2/3 workloads and Disaster Recovery cases
- VMware Horizon View will be supported in the GA release
- The minimum for VSAN is 3 ESXi nodes and the maximum is 32 nodes
- The minimum is 1 HDD and 1 SSD. The maximum is 35 HDDs and one SSD per 7 HDDs
- Minimum NIC speed is 1 Gbps, recommended NIC speed is 10 Gbps
- Replication is synchronously
- Every seven HDDs needs a SSD. SSD and HDD Ratio is 1:10 (GB)
- No de-dupe is supported in the GA version
- Hardware vendors such as Dell, HP and Cisco will support VSAN as VSAN Ready nodes. Watch the VMware Compatibility Guide at GA. [Link](http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=vsan)
- You can build your own VSAN with certified hardware
- There will be 13 pre configurations solutions available on the GA date

- JBOD is not supported in the GA release
- What is the difference with MS storage spaces: MS Storage spaces is presenting a file server from dedicated servers and JBODs. VSAN is object storage and doesnâ€™t require dedicated servers, it uses the same servers you have for your compute, and other benefits like flash cache acceleration, storage policy management and automation and more.
