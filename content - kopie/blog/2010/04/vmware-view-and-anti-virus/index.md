When designing a VMware View environment one important step is to look at the Anti-Virus solution going to be used. Not well designed Anti-Virus solutions can cause a lot of extra I/O and system spikes in virtual environments. This can result in a negatively user experience.

VMware has made an Anti-Virus deployment best practices whitepaper for Virtual Machines.  Topics as  ThinApp, linked clones, VMsafe and file exclusions etc. are all listed in the whitepaper.

The Anti-Virus deployment for VMware View whitepaper can be found here.
