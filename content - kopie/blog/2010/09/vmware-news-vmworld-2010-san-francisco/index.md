This was old news that VMware highlighted. Here’s a [link](http://www.youtube.com/user/VMworldTV#p/c/2B426681028B0AFD/14/6Tktk6iIjmI) with an interview with the ESXi team.

### VMware vShield

VMware announced the three new security products:

\- VMware vShield Endpoint – Offloaded Anti-virus and Anti-Malware

\- VMware vShield App – Application protection from Network–Based Threats

\- VMware vShield Edge – Security for Edge of the Virtual Datacenter

VMware vShield Endpoint is very interesting for VMware View environments. This solution can reduce the IOPS needed for every View desktop.

I hope there are still new announcements over for the VMword 2010 in Copenhagen.
