This issue occurs when the firewall rules on theÂ vRealize Operations Manager are incorrect. To resolve this issue update the firewall rules using the following steps:

- Open the VM console of the vRealize Operations Appliance or enable SSH (l[ink](https://www.ivobeerens.nl/2015/12/08/4105/))
- Log in as root user/
- Open the "/opt/vmware/etc/vmware-vcops-firewall.conf" file in vi
- Make sure the following entries are added to the V4V Adapter specific ports section

\# v4V Adapter specific ports TCPPORTS="$TCPPORTS 3091:3095" TCPPORTS="$TCPPORTS 3099:3101"

- Save the file
- Restart the firewall by using the following command:

/etc/init.d/vmware-vcops-firewall restart

Try to pair the adapter again. The pairing must now be successful.
