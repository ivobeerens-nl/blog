The long awaited VMware View with the PCoIP protocol has landed and is available for download.

VMware View 4.0 includes the following new features:

- **VMware View with PCoIP** – PCoIP provides an optimized desktop experience for the delivery of the entire desktop environment including applications, images, audio, and video content for a wide range of users on the LAN or across the WAN. PCoIP can compensate for an increase in latency or a reduction in bandwidth, to ensure that end users can remain productive regardless of network conditions.
- PCoIP includes **VMware View Display** with support for up to four monitors and the ability to deliver the optimal resolution and pivot orientation to each monitor independently.
- **VMware vSphere Support** – VMware vSphere 4 support enables improved virtual machine scalability, performance, and management, with continued support for VMware Infrastructure 3.x.
- **Enhanced single sign-on** – The **Log in as current user** feature is integrated with Active Directory and smart cards to help simplify the process of logging in to a VMware View desktop.
- **Restricted entitlements** – Administrators can control user access to virtual desktops based on the View Connection Server being used for authentication.
- **Smart card policies** – Administrators can set group policies to force desktop disconnection and require reconnection when users remove smart cards.
- **Domain filtering** – You can use <tt>vdmadmin.exe</tt> to control the accessibility of domains and traverse trust relationships more quickly.
- You can cleanly delete View desktops using scripts.
- You can log in to View desktops using user principal names (UPN).
- You can explicitly configure IP addresses to override those supplied by the View Agent when accessing a desktop.
- Mixed Active Directory and Kerberos authentication is supported.
